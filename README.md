# Questionable

This is a **server-side, optionally client-side** Fabric mod to make players a little more *useful*.

## Features

- Sitting on players: have a ride on someone's shoulders!
- Nametagging players: give someone a prefix to show off their role in the community!
- Leashing players: someone is misbehaving? make them unable to get away!

**Warning:** currently, if someone's sitting on you, you won't see it :c this is work-in-progress!

## Server vs. Client

| Feature  | Required on client | Required on server |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Saddles  |                    | ✅                  |
| Nametags | ✅                  | ✅                  |
| Leashes  |                    | ✅                  |

Client-side mod is only required for the name tags to show up :3
