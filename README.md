# Questionable

Have you ever wanted to make the other players on the server just a little bit more... useful? So did we. And we added riding others, to make the friend of yours not wait while you are AFK!

Or mess with them by giving them a funny nickname? We added it.

Or maybe even have your little sister who's also playing in a safe place, unable to go where _she_ wants? Hehe, just use a leash~

But here's a problem: it was a Spigot/Paper plugin. And those server softwares, as we all know, deviate from vanilla, sometimes in non-desirable ways... _And_ they don't support mods. _And_ they consume a f\*cking lot of your server's resources...

So the idea was to rewrite it all, _but_ (probably) less buggy, (arguably) more maintainable, _and_ as a Fabric mod! Which is what we did.

## Features

Warning: some features require the mod to be on both server _and_ the clients, some do not.

### Server-side only

* **Saddles**: sit on top of a player just like you would on a pig.. No, carrots on sticks don't work, at least they didn't when I was trying to use it.

### Optional client-side (but better with it)

* **Nametagging**: give that one rather bad-behaved friend a `Baka!` nickname near their username~
* **Leashing**: force someone to follow you wherever you'd go~ and yes, they will teleport to you if you're far away enough.

### Has to be everywhere

None! :p
